			<h3>Our products</h3>
			<p>
			Although cleaning your home is very important to us, we also have a responsibility to our plant and environment. We make sure that everything we use is not only eco-friendly but also safe and effective for your home.<br><br>

			Here are some of the ways we contribute our environment:<br><br>

			· Use reusable buckets and bottles.<br>
			· Reduce paper waste by online scheduling.<br>
			· Use safe, effective cleaning products i.e. all of our products are certified non-toxic, biodegradable and we do no use any dyes or scented formulas.<br>
			· Use washable and reusable microfiber rags that capture allergens better that disposable paper.
			</p>
			<h3>Policies/Terms</h3>
			<p><span class="underline">Cancellation Policy</span><br>

			We know life can get busy. So if it necessary to cancel or skip your scheduled service, Vail Butler requires a 3 business day notice. If we receive less than a 3 day business notice, we will have to charge you the full amount of your cleaning.<br><br>


			<span class="underline">Payment</span><br>
			Full payment is due at the time of your cleaning.<br>
			We accept checks and all major credit cards.<br><br>
			
			<span class="underline">Arrival Times</span><br>
			Our hours of operations are between 8:00am and 4:00 pm<br><br>

			<span class="underline">Let us make it right</span><br>
			We know cleaning can be a very personal and human service. At Vail Butler we realize that sometimes an area may not be cleaned to your satisfaction. Vail butler will happily re-clean any area of the house if notified within 24 hours of our initial cleaning.<br><br>

			<span class="underline">Breakage or loss</span><br>
			Vail Butler is fully insured. Our liability limits are set at a max of 10 times the cost of the service on the day in which the breakage or loss occurred. However, notification must be made within 24 hours of service. If notified after, we are not responsible or liable for any damage occurred.</p>
