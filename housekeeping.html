			<h3>Mission</h3>
			<p>Our mission is to provide the highest quality, professional and trustworthy cleaning service to our customers and their homes. Cleaning is a very personal offering, that is why we tailor our
			services and listen carefully to what your property needs? This way we can not only meet your expectations but exceed them every time.</p>
			<h3>How we work?</h3>
			<p>It is simple.<br>
			Using our online calendar, schedule the date and time you want your home to be cleaned. Once
			we have your details, someone from our agency will contact you to give you an estimate and
			confirm your appointment.<br><br>
			Want your house cleaned on a regular basis? No problem.<br><br>
			You can create a profile with us so you can update, re-schedule and leave notes on each of
			your appointments. You can schedule weekly, bi-weekly and monthly appointments.</p>
			<h3>What we offer?</h3>
			<p>Our 25-point checklist is our signature service that will ensure your house is spotless. In our
			uniquely designed checklist we cover everything from window cleaning and fan dusting to linen

			<h3>Our products</h3>
			<p>
			Although cleaning your home is very important to us, we also have a responsibility to our plant
			and environment. We make sure that everything we use is not only eco-friendly but also safe
			and effective for your home.<br><br>

			Here are some of the ways we contribute our environment:<br><br>

			· Use reusable buckets and bottles.<br>
			· Reduce paper waste by online scheduling.<br>
			· Use safe, effective cleaning products i.e. all of our products are certified non-toxic,
			biodegradable and we do no use any dyes or scented formulas.<br>
			· Use washable and reusable microfiber rags that capture allergens better that disposable
			paper
			</p>
			<h3>Policies/Terms</h3>
			<p><span class="underline">Cancellation Policy</span><br>

			We know life can get busy. So if it necessary to cancel or skip your scheduled service, PM
			requires a 3 business day notice. If we receive less than a 3 day business notice, we will have
			to charge you the full amount of your cleaning.<br><br>


			<span class="underline">Payment</span><br>
			Full payment is due at the time of your cleaning.<br>
			We accept checks and all major credit cards.<br><br>
			
			<span class="underline">Arrival Times</span><br>
			Our hours of operations are between 8:00am and 4:00 pm<br><br>

			<span class="underline">Let us make it right</span><br>
			We know cleaning can be a very personal and human service. At PM we realize that sometimes
			an area may not be cleaned to your satisfaction. PM will happily re-clean any area of the house
			if notified within 24 hours of our initial cleaning.<br><br>

			<span class="underline">Breakage or loss</span><br>
			PM is fully insured. Our liability limits are set at a max of 10 times the cost of the service on the
			day in which the breakage or loss occurred. However, notification must be made within 24 hours
			of service. If notified after, we are not responsible or liable for any damage occurred.</p>
